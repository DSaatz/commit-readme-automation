# Commit README Automation

A lightweight GitHub Action to automatically update your profile README with your **most recent commits**.  
Inspired by [br0sinski/readmefetch](https://github.com/br0sinski/readmefetch), but designed to be **minimal** and easily integrated with existing profile README setups.

The output is formatted to be reminiscent of a **terminal window**, giving your profile a clean, console-like look.

This will be the space in which your "console" will be displayed.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Trigger the Action
- The workflow runs every 30 minutes automatically. 
- You may change the value in the yml if you like it to trigger more often which I personally think would be redundant.
- You can also trigger it manually under **Actions > Update Profile README from External Repo**.
